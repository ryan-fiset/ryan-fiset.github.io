I found an immense interest in programming from an early age and nowadays focus on C++, Javascript, and whatever I feel like at the time. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has always been fascinating to me, even before it hit mainstream. Thus, when I discovered AI Camp's offerings, I was immediately hooked. I personally believe that AI is as revolutionary as some of human's greatest inventions, and its impact will mark a new era for mankind. To be present at this time is to leave an indelible mark on history.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">Hi, I'm Ryan a soon to be freshman at the University of Victoria. I've been programming for a few years mainly in low level systems work with Linux using C/C++ and Rust. Recently with the boom of AI I thought I should probably hop on the bandwagon as it starts to take off and I heard about AI camp and I thought it was a good opportunity to start. While I may not necessarily work on AI in the future as I like the work I do already it will open extra paths and help remove a lot of the mysticism behind AI.</p>
